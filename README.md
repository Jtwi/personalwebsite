My personal portfolio website. Made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Feel free to run the site for yourself. 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
